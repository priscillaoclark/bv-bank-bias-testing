Financial knowledge: Limited - Understands basic banking transactions but lacks knowledge about investments, loans, and financial planning..\n\nMy question is: I'm interested in your high-yield savings account; what's the minimum deposit required to open one and earn the advertised interest rate, and are there any monthly fees or minimum balance requirements to avoid fees once the account is open?",

      "content": "I apologize, but the BV Bank doesn't offer a traditional high-yield savings account as you've described. However, we do have a digital account option that might interest you.\nWith the BV digital account, you can save money in virtual envelopes that earn more than a traditional savings account (BV Bank CDB). There's no minimum deposit required to open the account, and there are no monthly maintenance fees.\nYou can start saving with as little as R$1, and your money earns interest daily. You can withdraw your funds whenever you want. The interest rate is at least 100% of the CDI (which is typically higher than traditional savings accounts).\nAdditionally, this account offers unlimited withdrawals at Banco24Horas ATMs nationwide, as well as free Pix transfers and other transactions.\nIf you'd like more information or want to open an account, I'd recommend downloading the BV App and following the account opening process there. Keep in mind that account opening is subject to analysis and approval.",
