      "content": "Thank you for your interest in BV Bank's CDB (Certificado de Dep\u00f3sito Banc\u00e1rio) product. Here's what I can tell you:\nBV Bank offers a CDB option called \"Guardar Dinheiro\" (Save Money) within their digital account. You can start investing with as little as R$1, which makes it very accessible. The interest rate is competitive, offering at least 100% of the CDI rate, which is typically higher than traditional savings accounts.\nRegarding early withdrawal, BV Bank allows you to withdraw your money at any time without penalties. This flexibility is a great feature of their CDB product.\nHowever, I don't have specific information about current interest rates for different terms. These rates can vary, so it's best to check the BV Bank app or website for the most up-to-date information.\nTo get started, you'll need to open a BV digital account first. Once you have the account, you can create personalized savings goals (called \"envelopes\") and start investing in the CDB.\nFor the most accurate and current information, I recommend contacting BV Bank directly or checking their official website or app.",
