The process for opening new accounts is currently unavailable.\nHowever, when it becomes available again, here's generally how it would work:\nDownload the BV Bank app\nEnter your personal information as requested\nWait for the security verification process to complete\nOnce verified, your account will be ready to use\nTypically, you'd need to provide basic personal information like your CPF (Brazilian tax ID). The entire process is designed to be quick and fully digital, without needing to visit a branch.\nFor now, I'd recommend checking the BV Bank website or app periodically for updates on when new account applications will reopen. In the meantime, you may want to explore other digital banking options that are currently accepting new customers.",
